# External verification walkthrough

This is the procedure a third party (auditor, opposing counsel's expert, insurer)
follows to validate a Pharos evidence chain **without trusting Pharos infrastructure**.
It requires only two inputs, an evidence bundle delivered out of band:

1. **Records** — the tenant's `ActionRecord`s as JSON, ordered by `sequence`.
2. **Keyset** — the published Ed25519 public keys (`keyId → publicKey`).

No database, no Pharos service, and no secret material are needed. The verifier
reimplements the algorithm below (or runs the reference implementation in
[`@pharos/core`](../packages/core/src/chain/verify.ts), which is pure and has no
infrastructure dependencies).

## The algorithm

For each record, in `sequence` order starting at 0:

1. **Schema** — the record conforms to ActionRecord v1 (see [schema-v1.md](./schema-v1.md)).
2. **Content hash** — compute `sha256(canonical(record.content))` and confirm it equals
   `record.seal.contentHash`. Canonicalization = sorted object keys, minified, arrays in
   order, `undefined` dropped.
3. **Signature** — verify `record.seal.signature` (base64 Ed25519) over the ASCII bytes
   of `record.seal.contentHash`, using the public key for `record.seal.keyId` from the
   keyset.
4. **Chain link** — confirm `record.seal.prevHash` equals the previous record's
   `contentHash` (for `sequence 0`, the genesis hash of 64 zeros).
5. **Sequence** — confirm `sequence` increments by exactly 1 with no gaps, and all
   records share one `tenantId`.

If every record passes, the chain is intact from genesis to head: no record was altered,
inserted, removed, or reordered after sealing. Because signatures are asymmetric, only
the holder of the KMS private key could have produced them — and that key never leaves
the KMS.

## Reference run

With the platform running (`pnpm api:up` equivalents) and demo data sealed:

```bash
pnpm infra:up
pnpm demo:durability            # seal demo records
pnpm api:dev &                  # serve the API
pnpm verify:external demo-tenant
```

Expected output:

```
=== External verification of tenant "demo-tenant" (offline, zero-trust) ===
Fetched 3 records and 1 public keys.
Verifying with @pharos/core ONLY (no DB, no signer, no platform calls)…

  ✅ seq   0  hash:ok sig:ok link:ok
  ✅ seq   1  hash:ok sig:ok link:ok
  ✅ seq   2  hash:ok sig:ok link:ok

Chain verification: PASS ✅ — admissible
```

The verifier script ([`scripts/external-verify.ts`](../scripts/external-verify.ts))
fetches the bundle over HTTP only for convenience; the verification itself calls
`verifyChain(records, keyset)` from `@pharos/core` and touches nothing else. Tamper with
any record body and re-run: the corresponding line flips to `hash:BAD` and the chain
fails — demonstrated by the `core.seal-verify` and `integration.durability` test suites.

## Key rotation

Rotating a signing key mints a new `keyId` (`<name>#v2`, `#v3`, …) while prior versions
remain in the published keyset. Each record embeds the `keyId` that signed it, so records
signed before and after a rotation both verify — chain continuity is preserved across
rotations. See the `core.signing` test suite.
